This is an experimental WebApp based explorer. It leverages Web BLE which needs to be manually enabled on your browser.
Current over the air update to MAX32xxx BLE microcontrollers is suppoerted is the BLE device is running the Analog devices [MSDK](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK/msdk) `BLE_otas` example.
